# kitcoin-frontend

A frontend for Kitcoin made with Svelte

**This is a submodule for [chromezoneeths/kitcoin](https://github.com/chromezoneeths/kitcoin).**

## Setup

Make sure Node.js and npm are installed.  
To install the required packages run the command below:

```bash
npm install
```

## Building

Building the frontend is pretty easy, just run the command below:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a folder called "build" containing the newly built frontend.

## Development

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Routify](https://www.routify.dev/) is used with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make the frontend, and Vite is used for builds.

To start the dev server, run the command below:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should open a new browser tab with the page open. The page will update as soon as you save a change, so you don't need to worry about reloading the page.  
You can also access the page by opening [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) once the dev server is up and running.
